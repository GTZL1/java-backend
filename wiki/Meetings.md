# Meetings

Team alignments are organized **three times** a week. They occur :

- On **Mondays at 10:00 AM**.
- On **Wednesdays at 09:00 AM**.
- On **Fridays at 10:00 AM**.

If you can't be there on time, please let the team know about it :-)

## Goals and non-goals

These regular team alignments have very specific goals, and there are a few
important non-goals and traps to avoid. At the end of the meeting :

- Everyone should be able to (vaguely) explain what his/her teammates will be
  working on until the next group alignment.

- Anyone with a technical or organizational blocker will have been able to
  share it with his/her teammates, and will have been able to plan a one-to-one
  chat with whoever can help them solve their issue.

- **Non-goal** : Team alignments must not replace technical discussions. They
  are aimed at solving organizational problems, not technical hiccups.

## Structure

There are a lot of ways to run team meetings. The following structure is
proposed, but it may vary as needed (and should therefore be considered as a
set of recommendations rather than mandatory points).

1. Everyone gets to present what they've been working on since the last
   meeting (or skip if there isn't anything to show).
   + If you plan to showcase something, please make sure to have it working and
     running before !

2. Once everyone has showed what is **working**, a second round is done with
   eventual blockers that members might have.
   + If you need help on something, this is when you should tell us about it !
     Someone else will be designated to give you a hand.

3. Once blockers have been adressed, a last round is planned to let you tell us
   about what you plan to be working on until the next meeting. This is the
   ideal time for open discussions if you don't know what to work on next, or
   feel like we need to plan future work differently.
   + You're not committing to work on what you're talking about; we're all
     adults, and you probably know well what the priorities of your  part of
     the project are.
     This round is just meant to indicate to your
     teammates what they should expect to see changing on the project in the
     next 2-3 days.
