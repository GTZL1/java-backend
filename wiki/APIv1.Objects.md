## General
When a list of objects needs to be sent, it will be done so using JSON arrays.

## Moderator

When a moderator needs to be sent by a client, it should be represented as so:

```json
{
  "username" : "guy-laurent",
  "password" : "1234"
}
```

  "idModerator" : "123",
  "token"       : "abcdefghi"
}
```

## Token

When a token needs to be sent by a client, it should be via the URL:

`/ex/ample?token=abcdefghi`

### Server
When the server needs to send a token, it should be represented as so:

```json
{
  "token" : "abcdefghi"
}
```

## Poll
### Client
When a client needs to send a poll, it should be represented as so:
```json
{
  "title" : "My title"
}
```

### Server
When the server needs to send a poll, it should be represented as so:
```json
{
  "idModerator" : {idModerator},
  "idPoll"      : {idPoll},
  "title"       : "My title"
}
```

## Session
**Note**: The `status` can be either:

* `open` meaning the session is active and people can connect to it
* `quarantined` meaning the session is active but people cannot connect to it anymore
* `closed` meaning the session is not active anymore

### Client
When the client needs to send a session, it should be represented as so:

```json
{
  "status"      : `open`
}
```
### Server
When the server needs to send a session, it should be represented as so:

```json
{
  "idModerator" : {idModerator},
  "idPoll"      : {idPoll},
  "idSession"   : {idSession},
  "code"        : "0xABCD",
  "status"      : `open`
}
```

## Question
**Note**: `indexInPoll` can be a `double`. In which case, the natural number ordering
is to be followed.

### Client
When a client needs to send a question, it should be represented as so:

```json
{
  "title"       : "This is a Question title",
  "details"     : "Comment",
  "visibility"  : "hidden",
  "indexInPoll" : 1,
  "answersMin"  : 1,

  "title"       : "First answer",
  "description" : "This is a description",
  "checked"     : {boolean, optional}

```

Answers that have been requested with a participant token will get the `checked` field, but
moderators will not see any field set.

### Client
When a client needs to send a vote for an answer, it should be represented as so:

```json
{

}
```

The value of `checked` is a boolean and should represent if the answer is selected in the user's UI.

are represented as so :

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Question title 1",
    "answers" :
      [
        { "title": "answer 1", "positive":  123, "negative": 123 },
        { "title": "answer 2", "positive":  123, "negative": 123 },
        { "title": "answer 3", "positive":  123, "negative": 123 }
      ]
  },
  {
    "title": "Question title 2",
    "answers" : []
  }
]
```

## Question statistics

An array of question statistics is requested for certain UNIX timestamps. The timestamps consider
the current time in seconds.

```json
[
  1589128713,
  1589128722
]
```

An array of question statistics is returned for a certain question at a set of different timestamps.
```json

    [
      {
        "idAnswer" : 1,
        "title": "Answer 1"
      },
      {
        "idAnswer" : 2,
        "title": "Answer 2"
      }
    ],

            },

              "count": 456
            }
          ]
      }
    ]
}
